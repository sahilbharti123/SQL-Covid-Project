## Data Analysis and Visualization of COVID-19 Impact and Vaccination Progress
# Overview
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on global and country-level statistics. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population, sourced from the "PortfolioProject" database. I utilized SQL queries to extract and manipulate the data, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's impact and the progress of vaccination campaigns.

# Data Sources

CovidDeaths Table: Contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population at the country and continent levels.
CovidVaccinations Table: Encompasses data related to COVID-19 vaccinations globally.

# Key Queries and Analysis

1. Total Deaths vs. Total Cases (India)
I investigated the relationship between total deaths and total cases in India, calculating the death percentage to gauge the severity of the outbreak.

2. Total Cases vs. Population (India)
Analyzing the total cases in India relative to its population, I computed the percentage of the population infected. This metric provides insights into the virus's spread in proportion to the country's population.

3. Countries with Highest Infection Rates Compared to Population
Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population, I presented a list sorted by the percentage of the population infected.

4. Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
Examining countries with the highest death counts per population, the analysis focused on identifying regions facing severe consequences in terms of mortality.

5. Global Overview
I provided a global perspective on COVID-19, presenting total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage over time. The results were visualized to showcase the pandemic's trajectory on a global scale.

6. Vaccination Progress
To assess vaccination progress, I correlated population data with vaccination statistics. I calculated the rolling total of people vaccinated over time and expressed it as a percentage of the population.

# Methods Used
SQL: Leveraged SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables.
Calculations: Utilized mathematical calculations to derive meaningful metrics, such as death percentage and percentage of population infected.
Views and Temporary Tables: Employed views and temporary tables for better organization and abstraction of complex queries.

# Results
The analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on a global and country-specific level. Insights into infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress offer valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and the general public.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL, showcasing the power of data-driven decision-making. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's dynamics, aiding in informed decision-making and public health efforts.
